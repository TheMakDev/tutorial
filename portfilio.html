                <p>Development of a robust and reliable online reporting platform for one of Africa's foremost dry cleaning companies, PrimeWash Limited.

                    PrimeWash Limited is a leading dry cleaning company in Nigeria and Africa. With branches across Nigeria, the workload for management from day to day can be hucculean.
                    
                    Our solution simplified their reporting processes by introducing a full fledge reporting platform to replace their style of sending emails for every activity, making it difficult to extrapolate data for analysis and decision making.</p>

                <p>We worked in partnership with Marshal Star Security Services to develop a student ID verification system for a Nigerian University.

                    This ID verification system is supported by a robust database of student records, making it very difficult for records to be tampered with.</p>

                <p>Deployment of Windows Server 2012 Active Directory Domain Services at the Corporate headquarters of Marshal Star Services Limited.

                    Before the deployment of our solution, the company had suffered data theft and sabotage by staff. In 2015 particularly, a staff was sacked and the fellow, in turn, carted away very sensitive data of the organization. Also, the company had suffered from various malware infections as a result of the peer-to-peer networking that was in place.
                    Our solution introduced a proper corporate networking system managed by a domain controller. Since installation to date, the company has not had a single case of malware infection and they are now more comfortable with their sensitive files.
